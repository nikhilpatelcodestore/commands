Turn on the SSH service and make sure it starts automatically on reboot.
# service sshd start
# chkconfig sshd on




The SSH service is configured using the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file. Configuration changes have to be followed by a restart of the service.
# service sshd restart
# # or
# service sshd reload
